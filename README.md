# Waypoint Data Collector MVP

# Download repo
# run python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/index.html

# Use the polygon tool to draw your area of operations
# Use the "generate waypoint" button to randomly generate a waypoint
# User will then drive to the waypoint and click "successfully reached waypoint" if successful
# If user cannot reach waypoint, they'll click "Waypoint cannot be reached" and be prompted as to why they couldn't reach it
# Waypoints and success/failures are stored on "View Saved Data" page - not yet hooked up to backend for permanent storage
